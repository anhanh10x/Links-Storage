This is a software I built using C# language on the .NET 6.0 platform. As the name suggests, Links Storage is used to store and categorize links. The software has the following features:
ðŸ“Œ Link Storage: Links are stored with titles and organized by topics, making them more vivid and easy to search.
ðŸ“Œ Share Links: Instead of copying and pasting individual links to share with friends, you can simply press the share button in the software, which will automatically generate records. All you need to do is send those records to your friends.
ðŸ“Œ Add Links: After receiving files, all you need to do is press the "add link" button, and all the links organized by topics that your friend has prepared will be presented to you.
ðŸ“Œ Search: You can easily search for links based on their titles. The entire search history is saved for your convenience for future reference.
ðŸ“Œ Pomodoro: This incredibly useful feature helps us relax to improve work efficiency. After every 25 minutes, the software will lock the screen to remind the user.

Please install .net 6.0 first
